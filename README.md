# information_visualisation_-IPL-analysis
Cricket is one of the famous outdoor sports that contain a large set of statistical data in real
world. As IPL games rise in popularity, it is necessary to examine the possible predictors that
affect the outcome of the matches. The project aims at analysing the IPL cricket match results
from the dataset collected (2008-2017) . Analysis of structured data has seen tremendous
success in the past. However, analysis of large scale unstructured data to perform
predictions remains a challenging area. The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a T20
cricket league tournament held in India contested during April and May of every year where
top players from all over the world take part. The IPL is the most-attended cricket
league in the world and ranks sixth among all sports leagues. The idea is to analyse the IPL
data hosted by Kaggle to come up with something interesting and useful. We have
used various graphs and plots for doing this analysis. The project utilizes the IPL datasets that
allows analyst to incorporate functions that are used by IPL application to fetch and view
information. This project uses python, Python packages are: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and
seaborn and tableau, K-means clustering to extract the meaningful output which can be used
by the management for analysis.
